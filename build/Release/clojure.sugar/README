Notes

Actions.xml:
CJIndent
Made for this sugar only
The special tag specifies function calls whose contents will always be indented by + 2 spaces instead to the first argument.

CJZoneTree
Can be used for other sugars
The zone tag specifies zones that will be identified as a traversable expression.
Use the expression tag to further filter the zones.

ClojureSyntax.xml:
Follows the standard specified in the sugar development forum.
